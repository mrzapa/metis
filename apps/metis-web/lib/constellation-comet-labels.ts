/**
 * Path-text rendering for comet headline labels.
 *
 * Phase 1 (this file's current state) ships a tracer-bullet path-text
 * implementation: per-character position by arc length walk along the
 * comet's tail polyline, raw per-character spline tangent, no
 * truncation/flip/collision/reduced-motion mitigations. Those land in
 * Phase 2.
 *
 * See `docs/plans/2026-05-01-comet-headline-labels-design.md` for the
 * full design and `docs/plans/2026-05-01-comet-headline-labels-implementation.md`
 * for the phase boundaries.
